ok so point of this program was to sorta create a way of simulating turn flow in edh    
    games played between my roommates and i using different decks

this should be a collection of files


file outline:
gen: manages program flow - what are game actions and states
    each game is initialized by four decks being chosen and imported, 

each deck has been ammortizxed to approximations of what the deck does 
    resources to be used and roles that decks would have
